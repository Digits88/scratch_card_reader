#scratch_card_reader
===================

##Introduction
Scratch Card Reader is my attempt in understanding how OCR works/performs on Android (the does and dont's of OCR regardless of approach used). Some of the code in this repo is therefore not of the highest quality and is also undocumented. Feel free to document any piece of code you think needs documentation.

##Setup
Scratch Card Reader utilizes Tesseract for OCR. You therefore need to setup Tesseract as a seperate android project (on Eclipse) and import that project to this one as a library. Note that Scratch Card Reader is also an eclipse project. You can learn how to setup and how to compile the Tesseract project by reading [this post]: http://gaut.am/making-an-ocr-android-app-using-tesseract
